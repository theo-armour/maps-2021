## Concept

* Download RMA sample data files from GitHub Page server using XMLHttpRequest. Files are typically4MB ZIP files.
* Decompress the files usin JSZip.js. Uncompressed files are typically 38 MB with over 125,000 lines of CSV-type data with 30 fields
* Parse the data into an array of arrays in JSON format
* Report file size, number of lines, time to load
* Display the first 30 lines of records

At run time, you can

* Click on a list of years to load, parse and display its data
Sample data files from here:
* Click on a list of all the field headings to display the data for that field
	* If the data is categorical (FIPs code of name of a state), find al the unique values and list their count
	* if the data is tabular * number of acres or size of indemnity, list the sum, average, minumn and maximum of all values
* Click a button to view a list of all the counties showing county name, state, FIPs code, acres planted, total liability and total indemnity.

><b>Cause of Loss Historical Data Files</b>
>Summarized participation information broken down by the causes of loss. Each link contains a ZIP file with compressed data containing pipe (|) delimited flat-files that can be imported into any standard spreadsheet and/or database for further analysis. Record description file located in each subfolder.

## To Do / Wish List

* It would be nice to be able to access the files directly off the USDA server
